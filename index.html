        <p class="content">As Fredric Jameson famously remarked, it is now easier for us to imagine the end of the world
          than an alternative to capitalism. Yet alternatives are exactly what we need. We need to dream new dreams for
          the twenty-first century as those of the twentieth century rapidly fade. But what role can design play?

          When people think of design, most believe it is about problem solving. Even the more expressive forms of
          design are about solving aesthetic problems. Faced with huge challenges such as overpopulation, water
          shortages, and climate change, designers feel an overpowering urge to work together to fix them, as though
          they can be broken down, quantified, and solved. Design’s inherent optimism leaves no alternative but it is
          becoming clear that many of the challenges we face today are unfixable and that the only way to overcome them
          is by changing our values, beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. Although essential most of the time, design’s
          inbuilt optimism can greatly complicate things, first, as a form of denial that the problems we face are more
          serious than they appear, and second, by channeling energy and resources into fiddling with the world out
          there rather than the ideas and attitudes inside our heads that shape the world out there.

          Rather than giving up altogether, though, there are other possibilities for design: one is to use design as a
          means of speculating how things could be—speculative design. This form of design thrives on imagination and
          aims to open up new perspectives on what are sometimes called wicked problems, to create spaces for discussion
          and debate about alternative ways of being, and to inspire and encourage people’s imaginations to flow freely.
          Design speculations can act as a catalyst for collectively redefining our relationship to reality.</p>
